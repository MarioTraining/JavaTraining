** Restriction 1: 
	You cannot embed a youtube or dailymotion video using the <video> element
	
	Help! <video src="my youtube video url"></video> doesn work.
	
	You cannot directly embed videos from most of the popular social Web sites such as YouTube,
	Dailymotion, Vimeo, etc. For commercial reasons, and because advertising is automatically 
	added to the videos, thes Web sites do not allow "regular" embedding of their videos.

	While they use HTML5 to render their videos, these hosting sites (YouTube, etc.) use 
	rather complex techniques in order to prevent you from using them with the <video> element. 
	Instead, you often need to embed an <iframe> that will render the HTML5 videos in your 
	Web site, and of course, the advertising that comes along with them

	<iframe width="560" height="315" 
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZH1XOsv8Oyo" 
	frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

** Restriction 2: 
	The <track> element cannot be used with a 
	file:// URL. Please use http:// and a Web server. Your server must use a special 
	MIME format for the .vtt files: text/vtt;charset=utf-8 (set by default on most servers now).

	Examples of the lines to add to an Apache Web server:

	<Files mysubtitle.vtt>
		ForceType text/vtt;charset=utf-8
	</Files>
	It might be worth mentioning that most browsers work fine with WebVTT even if 
	the MIME Type is not set, but Internet Explorer doesn’t: in fact it will ignore 
	WebVTT entirely unless the MIME Type is set correctly!
	
** Best Practice 1:
	do not use autoplay and add preload="none" if you target mobile devices or 
	if you have multiple audio/video on the same page. For example, this page 
	contains many audio elements and it does not make sense to have them preload or autoplay.
	
** Best Practice 2:	
	think twice before using the autoplay attribute, even for desktop applications.
