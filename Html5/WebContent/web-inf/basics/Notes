Best Practice 1: Always add a heading to explicit sectioning content.

	It's always better - mainly for accessibility reasons - to include a 
	heading (a <h1>, <h2>...<h6>) in each sectioning element 
	(<section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>), but also after the <body> 
	element (called a "sectioning root"). 
	
	<section>
   		<header>
      		<h1>Blog post of April 2015</h1>
      		<p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
   		</header>
		...
	</section>
